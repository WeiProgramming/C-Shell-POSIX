I wrote this code myself - Wei Leung

There are many bugs regarding this code 
Mainly the bugs found that through the input testing from the autograder. I found that inputs 18,17,19,88
do not work. I was not able to correctly handle >>& redirection, reading \| correctly, as well as not being able to treat #
as a comment correctly when reading command as a script file, and lastly, I was not able to handle buffer overruns as well as continuously print after premature EOF,
further known bugs that I know of and not tested with the inut tests are my history command !! which only works up till the 9th command.
